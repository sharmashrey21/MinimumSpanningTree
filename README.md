# Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm)
In this project, I implemented the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph, using
the Kruskal’s algorithm. We consider the nodes in the graph to be numbered from 0 to n – 1. This means
a graph with 4 nodes, has nodes named 0, 1, 2 and 3. Each edge has a weight (a positive number and of
double type) associated with it.
